                        <h4>I am a junior front end web developer</h4>
                        <h5>based in Surrey, near London.</h5>
                        <p> I studied in Vietnam and completed my Bachelor's Degree in Maths Pedagogy in 2010 and I have worked for secondary schools as a Maths teacher for several years before coming to the UK. I now feel that it is time to realise my dream of working in the IT industry.</p>
                        <p> I have always been interested in computers and technology, ever since my father encouraged me to learn how to use computers when i was 8. Computers have been a part of my life since then. I learned Visual Basic when I was 16 as it was a compulsory subject at school and I totally enjoyed using my Maths and Art skills to create good looking useful programmes.</p>
                        <p>I have completed a self-funded course in front end web development with a training and recruitment company called Just IT. This has taken my understanding to the next level and goes towards making my passion a reality.</p>
                        <p>I am a highly effective and committed individual with strong problem solving Maths abilities, combining good organisational skills and computer languages. I have knowledge of Adobe Photoshop, Corel Draw with a natural flair for creativity and a keen eye for detail, now seeking a role as a junior front-end developer.</p>
